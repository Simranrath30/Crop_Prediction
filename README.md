# Crop_Prediction
This project is an AI-powered Crop Prediction System that recommends the most suitable crop based on various soil and climate parameters. Using Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier), the model analyzes input features like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall to suggest the best crop for cultivation.
